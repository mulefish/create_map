## What is this?
Ever wanted to create a map but did not have ArcVUE GIS? Me too. This simple tool will load an image and then you click around on it to create xy points that could then be used in canvas/d3/imagemap ect ect... 

## Tech stack? 
D3 version5

## Server?
This has no backend : you will need to supply your own server. I use python3 -m http.server 3030
