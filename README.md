## create_map

For a  geojson based game we need  a map. Finding an google map is difficult. This will will be to add layers to geojson. We will be able to add any number of layers. Each layer's semantics will be different. Maybe one will be for 'farm land' and another might be 'speed of travel' or...  ...or anythin  g really.
## currently working on main.html
main.html is the furthest experiment so far


## running

Currently there is *zero* backend. It will use localstorage in the browser for persistance. So you will need to supply a webserver. I use: 

python3 -m http.server 3030
